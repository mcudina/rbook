A point is chosen at random, uniformly in the unit cube $[0,1]\times
[0,1]\times [0,1]$. Its distance to the origin $(0,0)$ is measured,
and turns out to be equal to $1.5$.

Use simulations to estimate the shape of the pdf of the conditional
distribution of the point's <!--'--> distance to $(1,1,1)$. Compare
it to the unconditional case, i.e., the case where no information
about the distance to $(0,0,0)$ is known.

Compute the mean of this (conditional) distribution for a few values
of the parameter $\eps$ you use to deal with conditioning in the
continuous case. Make sure you include values of $\eps$ on both sides
of the spectrum - too big, and too small.
