1. Find the Weibull distribution in R's help system.<!-- ' -->
Simulate $n=10000$ draws from the Weibull distribution with shape parameter $2$ and scale parameter $3$. Draw a histogram of your simulations. 

2.  Suppose that the vector `x` contains $n=10000$ simulations from the standard
    normal $\mu=0, \sigma=1)$. Without simulating any new random numbers,
    transform it into the vector `y` such that `y` is a vector of $n=10000$
    simulations from the normal with $\mu=1$ and $\sigma=0.5$. Draw histograms
    of both `x` and `y` on the same plot. (*Note:* the extra parameter `add` is
    used to superimpose plots. You may want to use different colors, too. Use
    the e parameter `col` for that. )

3.  Starting with `x=seq(-3,3,by=0.1)`, define the appropriate vector `y` and
    use `x` and `y` to plot the graph of the cdf of the standard normal. The
    command you want to use is `plot` with the following extra arguments
     - `type="l"` (to get a smooth line instead of a bunch of points). 
     - `main="The CDF of the standard normal"` (to set the title), and
     -  another argument (which you must look up yourself) that will set the $y$-axis label to $F(x)$.
