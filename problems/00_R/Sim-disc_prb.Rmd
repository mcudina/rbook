Simulate $n=10000$ draws from the joint distribution given by the following
table:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
df = data.frame(matrix(c(0.1,0.0,0.3,0.1,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4),
                       nrow=3, byrow=TRUE))
colnames(df) = c("1","2","3")
rownames(df) = c("1","2","3")
kable(df, 
      # striped=TRUE, 
      row.names=TRUE) %>% 
   column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
   kable_styling(full_width=FALSE)
```


Display the contingency table of your results, as well as a table
showing the
"errors", i.e., differences between the theoretical frequencies
 (i.e., probabilities given above) and the obtained relative
 frequencies in the sample.
