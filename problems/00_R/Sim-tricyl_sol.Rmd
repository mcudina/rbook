By the very construction, it is clear that the entire tricylinder lies
within the cube $[-1,1]\times [-1,1] \times[-1,1]$. Therefore, we can
compute its volume by simulating random draws from the uniform
distribution in that cube, and computing the relative frequence of
those values that fall inside the tricylinder. The whole point is
that it is easy to check, given a point $(x,y,z)$,  whether it lies
inside the tricylinder or not. Indeed, the answer is "yes" if and
only if all three of the following inequalities are satisfied: $$
x^2+y^2 \le 1,\  x^2+z^2\leq 1 \text{ and } y^2+z^2\leq 1.$$

```{r} 
nsim=10000 
x = runif(nsim, min=-1, max=1) 
y = runif(nsim, min=-1, max=1) 
z = runif(nsim, min=-1, max=1) 
is_in = (x^2+y^2 <= 1) & (x^2+z^2 <= 1) & (y^2+z^2 <= 1)

(2^3*sum (is_in)/nsim)
```

We multiplied by $2^3$ because that is the volume of the cube
$[-1,1]\times [-1,1] \times [-1,1]$. Without it, we would get the
portion of the cube taken by the tricylinder, and not its volume. 

The true value of $8(2-\sqrt{2})$ is, approximately, $4.6862$.
