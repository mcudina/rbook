1. Simulate $10000$ draws from a uniform distribution inside the cube
$[-1,1]\times[-1,1] \times [-1,1]$. Go through your simulations, and discard the
ones that do not lie within the unit ball (the ball centered around $(0,0,0)$,
with radius $1$.) Now you have a bunch of uniform simulations from the unit ball
(Do not display them).

2. Use your simulations to estimate the mean and the standard deviation of $W$,
where $W$ is the distance from the the origin to a randomly and uniformly 
chosen point in the unit ball. 

3. A point was chosen randomly and uniformly in the unit ball, and it has been observed
that it is closer to the point $(1,-1,1)$ than to $(1,-1,-1)$. Estimate (graphically)
the shape of the conditional pdf of its distance to the origin, given this observation.

4. (extra credit) Do 3., but with the point chosen uniformly over the *surface*
of the ball and for the distance to the point $(1,1,1)$ and not to the origin
(which is always $1$ in this case). Even more extra points if you do not draw
any additional simulations.
