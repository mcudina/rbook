Harry Potter's cousin Nigel Potter owns a magical set of three dice. They behave just like any three (fair, independent) 6-sided dice, except for the fact that, when thrown together, they always show three *distinct* numbers. In other words, the outcomes with repeating numbers never happen, while all combinations of three distinct numbers are equally likely. 

1. Create a large ($\ge 10,000$) set of simulations of throws of these magical dice. Use any method you like. 

2. Output the contingency table for the outcomes of the first two dice, and compare to theoretical probabilities. 

3. Draw samples from the  conditional distribution of the outcome of the third die, given that the sum on the first two is $6$. Display the contingency table for your outcomes.  

4. (Extra credit) Find the (theoretical) conditional distribution of the third die given that the sum on the first two is $6$, and compare it to your result from 3. above.
