1.  Find the beta distribution in R's help system. The only
  thing you need to know about it is that it comes with two positive
  parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (called `shape1` and `shape2` in R).
  Simulate $n=10000$ draws from the beta distribution with parameters
  $\alpha=0.5$ and $\beta=0.3$. Plot a density histogram of your
  simulations as well as the pdf of the underlying distribution on the
  same plot. (Note: if you use the command `lines` instead of `plot`
  for the pdf, it will be automatically added to your previous plot -
  the histogram, in this case).  

2.  Let $X$ be a beta-distributed random variable with parameters
$\alpha=0.5$ and $\beta=0.3$ (as above), and let $Y$ be an
independent random variable with the same distribution. Estimate the
probability $\PP[ XY > 1+ \log(Y)]$. Check graphically whether $XY$
and $1+\log(Y)$ are independent random variables. 

3. Let $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ be three independent random variables
uniformly distributed on $(0,1)$, and let $M = \min(X,Y,Z)$.  A
theorem in probability states that $M$ has a beta distribution with
some parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Use simulation (and associated
plots) to make an educated guess about what the values of $\alpha$
and $\beta$ are. (Hint: they are nice round numbers.)
