1. 
	Define two variables $a$ and $b$ with values $3$ and $4$ and "put" their product into a variable called $c$. Output the value of $c$.

2. 
	Define two vectors $x$ and $y$ of length $3$, such that the components of $x$ are $1,2,3$ and the components of $y$ are $8,9,0$. Ouput their (componentwise) sum.

3. 
	Define a $2\times 2$ matrix $A=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -1 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$.

4. Compute the matrix square $A^2$.
