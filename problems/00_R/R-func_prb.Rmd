1. 
	Write a function that takes a numerical argument $x$ and returns $5$ if $x\geq 5$ and $x$ itself otherwise.

2. 
	Write a function that returns `TRUE` (a logical value) if its argument is between $2$ and $3$ and `FALSE` otherwise. 

3. 
	(Extra credit) Write a function that takes two equal-sized vectors as arguments and returns the angle between them in degrees. For definiteness, the angle between two vectors is defined to be $0$ when either one of them is $(0,0,\dots,0)$.
