1. Let $f_1$ and $f_2$ be two pdfs. We take a constant $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and define the function $f$ by
$$ f(x) = \alpha f_1(x) + (1-\alpha) f_2(x).$$
The function $f$ is the pdf of a third distribution, which is called the
**mixture of $f_1$ and $f_2$ with weights $\alpha$ and $1-\alpha$**.
Assuming that you know how to simulate from the distributions with pdfs $f_1$
and $f_2$, how would you draw $10,000$ simulations from the mixture $f$? Show
your method on the example of a mixture of $N(0,1)$ and $N(4,1)$ with
$\alpha=2/3$. Plot the histogram of the obtained sample (play with the
parameter `breaks` until you get a nice picture.)
   
   (*Hint:* start with two vectors, the first containing $10,000$ simulations from
$f_1$ and the second from $f_2$. Then "toss" $10,000$ biased coins with
$\mathbb{P}[ H ] = \alpha$ ... )

2. The **double exponential** or
**Laplace** distribution is a continuous probability distribution whose pdf is
given by $$ \tfrac{1}{2} \exp(-|x|), x\in {\mathbb R}.$$ This distribution
is not built into R. How would you produce simulations from the double
exponential using R?
