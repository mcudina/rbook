We learned how to simulate from a joint distribution of two discrete vectors
$(X,Y$) by thinking of it as one-dimensional distribution but with values
represented by pairs of numbers. Here is another way this can be done:
  
a. Find the marginal distribution of one of them, say $X$, and simulate from it

b. Given the value you just obtained, let's <!--'--> call it $x$,  simulate from the conditional distribution of $Y$, given $X=x$. 

Implement this procedure on the following joint distribution:
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
df = data.frame(matrix(c(0.1,0.0,0.3,0.1,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4),
                    nrow=3, byrow=TRUE))
colnames(df) = c("1","2","3")
rownames(df) = c("1","2","3")
kable(df, 
      # striped=TRUE, 
      row.names=TRUE) %>% 
column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
kable_styling(full_width=FALSE)
```


Display the contingency table of your simulations, first using counts, and then
using relative frequencies. Compare to the theoretical values (i.e., the
probabilities in the table above).
