A basic method for obtaining simulations draws from distributions
other than the uniform is the **transformation method**. The idea is
to start with (pseudo) random numbers, i.e., draws from the uniform
$U(0,1)$ distribution, and then apply a function $g$ to each
simulation. The difficulty is, of course, how to choose the right
function $g$. <br> Let $X$ be a random variable with a continuous and
strictly increasing cdf $F$. What is the distribution of $Y=F
(X)$? What does that have to do with the transformation method?
   
(Hint: if you are having difficulty with this problem, feel free to
run some experiments using R. )
